// Choice: what an answer is and the one message the user sends. Pure logic, no pi imports.
// A click stages an answer; nothing is sent until the user presses Send answers, and then every Choice of the widget goes in ONE
// message. Port of hermes-openui's choice-core.js, on pi-openui's own cleaning rules (notes.ts).
//
// The message is the contract with the agent. One single-choice question answered with an option keeps the line agents already
// know, `<question> — <option>`. Anything else is a numbered list. The agent wrote the question and the options and the message
// is sent without a review step, so those words are cleaned like a Notes quote: control and invisible characters out, whitespace
// collapsed, `@file:`-style references defused. The user's own Other text is theirs: only control characters go.
